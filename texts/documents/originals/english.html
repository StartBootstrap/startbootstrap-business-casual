  	   <p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
  	   <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,</p>
  	   <p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
  	   <p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee <a href="#1" id="1back">(1)</a>,</p>
  	   <p>Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,</p>
  	   <p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty <a href="#2" id="2back">(2)</a>,</p>
  	   <p>Whereas:</p>

  	   <ol>
  	     <li>Council Directive 90/219/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms <a href="#3" id="3back">(3)</a> has been substantially amended several times <a href="#4" id="4back">(4)</a>. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.</li>
  		   <li>Under the Treaty, action by the Community relating to the environment must be based on the principle that preventive action is to be taken and must have as its objective, among other things, the preservation, protection and improvement of the environment and the protection of human health.</li>
  		   <li>Measures concerning the evaluation and best use of biotechnology with regard to the environment are a priority area on which Community action should concentrate.</li>
  		   <li>The development of biotechnology is such as to contribute to the economic expansion of the Member States. This involves the use of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMs) in operations of various types and scales.</li>
  		   <li>The contained use of GMMs should be such as to limit their possible negative consequences for human health and the environment, due attention being given to the prevention of accidents and the control of waste.</li>
  		   <li>GMMs which are disposed of without appropriate provisions for specific containment measures to limit their contact with the general population and the environment do not fall within the scope of this Directive. Other Community legislation such as Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms <a href="#5" id="5back">(5)</a> may apply.</li>
  		   <li>Micro-organisms, if released into the environment in one Member State in the course of their contained use, may reproduce and spread, crossing national frontiers and thereby affecting other Member States.</li>
  		   <li>In order to bring about the safe development of biotechnology throughout the Community, it is necessary to establish common measures for the evaluation and reduction of the potential risks arising in the course of all operations involving the contained use of GMMs and to set appropriate conditions of use.</li>
  		   <li>The precise nature and scale of risks associated with the contained use of GMMs are not yet fully known and the risk involved must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In order to evaluate the risk to human health and the environment, it is necessary to lay down requirements for risk assessment.</li>
  		   <li>Contained uses of GMMs should be classified in relation to the risks they present to human health and the environment. Such classification should be in line with international practice and based on an assessment of the risk.</li>
  		   <li>In order to ensure a high level of protection, the containment and other protective measures applied to a contained use must correspond to the classification of the contained use. Where there is any uncertainty, the appropriate containment and other protective measures for the higher classification should be applied until less stringent measures are justified by appropriate data.</li>
  		   <li>For all activities involving GMMs the principles of good microbiological practice and good occupational safety and hygiene should apply in accordance with relevant Community legislation.</li>
  		   <li>Appropriate containment measures should be applied at the various stages of an operation to control emissions and the disposal of material from contained uses of GMMs, and to prevent accidents.</li>
  		   <li>Any person, before undertaking for the first time the contained use of a GMM in a particular installation, should forward a notification to the competent authority so that the authority may satisfy itself that the proposed installation is appropriate for the purposes of carrying out the activity in a manner that does not present a hazard to human health and the environment.</li>
  		   <li>It is also necessary to establish appropriate procedures for the case-by-case notification of specific operations involving the contained use of GMMs, taking account of the degree of risk involved.</li>
  		   <li>In the case of operations involving high risk, the consent of the competent authority should be given.</li>
  		   <li>The containment and other protective measures applied to contained uses should be reviewed periodically.</li>
  		   <li>It may be considered appropriate to consult the public on the contained use of GMMs.</li>
  		   <li>People employed in contained uses should be consulted in accordance with the requirements of relevant Community legislation, in particular Directive 2000/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work (seventh individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) <a href="#6" id="6back">(6)</a>.</li>
  		   <li>Appropriate measures should be taken to inform any person liable to be affected by an accident on all matters relating to safety.</li>
  		   <li>Emergency plans should be established to deal effectively with accidents.</li>
  		   <li>If an accident occurs, the user should immediately inform the competent authority and communicate the information necessary for assessing the impact of that accident and for taking the appropriate action.</li>
  		   <li>It is appropriate for the Commission, in consultation with the Member States, to establish a procedure for the exchange of information on accidents and for the Commission to set up a register of such accidents.</li>
  		   <li>The contained use of GMMs throughout the Community should be monitored, and to this end Member States should supply certain information to the Commission.</li>
  		   <li>In order to be considered safe for human health and the environment, GMMs should meet the list of criteria as defined in Annex II, Part B. To take account of the pace at which biotechnology is advancing, the nature of the criteria to be developed and the limited scope of that list, it is appropriate for the Council to revise those criteria, which should, where necessary, be supplemented by guidance notes to facilitate their application.</li>
  		   <li>The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission <a href="#7" id="7back">(7).</a></li>
  		   <li>In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the amendments necessary to adapt Annexes II, III, IV and V to technical progress, and to adapt Annex II, Part C. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.</li>
  		   <li>The new elements introduced into this Directive concern only the committee procedures. They therefore do not need to be transposed by the Member States.</li>
  		   <li>This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex VI, Part B,</li>
       </ol>
  	   <p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>

       </ol>
     </section>
     <section>
       <h4>Article 4</h4>
         <ol>
           <li>Member States shall ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the contained use of GMMs.</li>
  	       <li>To that end, the user shall carry out an assessment of the contained uses as regards the risks to human health and the environment that those contained uses may pose, using as a minimum the elements of assessment and the procedure set out in Annex III, Sections A and B.</li>
  	       <li>The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall result in the final classification of the contained uses in four classes applying the procedure set out in Annex III, which will result in the assignment of containment levels in accordance with Article 5:
             <table>
               <tr>
                 <td>Class 1:</td>
                 <td>activities of no or negligible risk, that is to say activities for which level 1 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>Class 2:</td>
                 <td>activities of low risk, that is to say activities for which level 2 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>Class 3:</td>
                 <td>activities of moderate risk, that is to say activities for which level 3 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>Class 4:</td>
                 <td>activities of high risk, that is to say activities for which level 4 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.</td>
               </tr>
            </table>
           </li>
  	       <li>Where there is doubt as to which class is appropriate for the proposed contained use, the more stringent protective measures shall be applied unless, by agreement with the competent authority, there is sufficient evidence to justify the application of less stringent measures.</li>
  	       <li>The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall especially take into account the question of disposal of waste and effluents. Where appropriate, the safety measures needed in order to protect human health and the environment shall be implemented.</li>
  	       <li>A record of the assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall be kept by the user and made available in an appropriate form to the competent authority as part of the notification pursuant to Articles 6, 8 and 9 or on request.</li>
         </ol>
     </section>
  	 <section>
       <h4>Article 5</h4>
       <ol>
  	     <li>Save to the extent that point 2 of Annex IV allows other measures to be applied, the user shall apply the general principles and the appropriate containment and other protective measures set out in Annex IV corresponding to the class of the contained use, so as to keep workplace and environmental exposure to any GMMs to the lowest reasonably practicable level, and so that a high level of safety is ensured.</li>
  	     <li>The assessment referred to in Article 4(2) and the containment and other protective measures applied shall be reviewed periodically, and forthwith if:</p>
  	       <ol>
  		       <li>the containment measures applied are no longer adequate or the class assigned to the contained uses is no longer correct; or</li>
  		       <li>there is reason to suspect that the assessment is no longer appropriate judged in the light of new scientific or technical knowledge.</li>

    	  <p><em>PART B</em></p>
    	  <p><em>Criteria establishing the safety of GMMs for human health and the environment</em></p>
        <p>This Annex describes in general terms the criteria to be met when establishing the safety of types of GMMs for human health and the environment and their suitability for inclusion in Part C. Technical guidance notes may be developed in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 20(3) in order to facilitate the implementation and explanation of this Annex.</p>
    	  <ol>
          <li>
            <em>Introduction</em><br>
      	     Types of GMMs listed in Part C in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 20(2) are excluded from the scope of this Directive. GMMs will be added to the list on a case-by-case basis and exclusion will relate only to each clearly identified GMM. This exclusion applies only when the GMM is used under conditions of contained use as defined in point (c) of Article 2. It does not apply to the deliberate release of GMMs. For a GMM to be listed in Part C, it must be proved that it meets the criteria given below.
          </li>
      	  <li>
            <em>General criteria</em>
            <ol>
          	  <li><em>Strain verification/authentication</em><br>Identity of the strain must be precisely established. Modification must be known and verified.</li>
          	  <li><em>Documented and established evidence of safety</em><br>Documented evidence of the safety of the organism must be provided.</li>
          	  <li><em>Genetic stability</em><br>Where any instability could adversely affect safety, evidence of stability is required.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Specific criteria</em>
            <ol>
          	  <li><em>Non-pathogenic</em><br>The GMM should not be capable of causing disease or harm to a healthy human, plant or animal. Since pathogenicity includes both toxigenicity and allergenicity, the GMM should therefore be:
            	  <ol>
                  <li><em>Non-toxigenic</em><br>The GMM should not produce increased toxigenicity as a result of the genetic modification nor be noted for its toxigenic properties.</li>
                  <li><em>Non-allergenic</em><br>The GMM should not produce increased allergenicity as a result of the genetic modification nor be a noted allergen, having, for example, allergenicity comparable in particular with that of the micro-organisms identified in Directive 2000/54/EC.</li>
                </ol></li>
          	  <li><em>No harmful adventitious agents</em><br>The GMM should not harbour known harmful adventitious agents such as other micro-organisms, active or latent, existing alongside or inside the GMM, that could cause harm to human health and the environment.</li>
          	  <li><em>Transfer of genetic material</em><br>The modified genetic material must not give rise to harm if transferred; nor should it be self-transmissible or transferable at a frequency greater than other genes of the recipient or parental micro-organism.</li>
          	  <li><em>Safety for the environment in the event of a significant and unintended release</em><br>GMMs must not produce adverse effects on the environment, immediate or delayed, should any incident involving a significant and unintended release occur.<br>GMMs that do not meet the above criteria may not be included in Part C.</li>
            </ol>

  	  <h4>ANNEX III</h4>
  	  <p><em>Principles to be followed for the assessment referred to in Article 4(2)</em></p>
  	  <p>This Annex describes in general terms the elements to be considered and the procedure to be followed to perform the assessment referred to in Article 4(2). Technical guidance notes <a href="#1annexIII" id="1annexIIIback">(1)</a> may be developed in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 20(3) in order to facilitate the implementation and explanation of this Annex, in particular as regards Section B.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Elements of assessment</em>
      	  <ol>
      	    <li>The following should be considered as potentially harmful effects:</p>
              <ul>
        		    <li>disease to humans, including allergenic or toxic effects,</li>
        			  <li>disease to animals or plants,</li>
        			  <li>deleterious effects due to the impossibility of treating a disease or providing an effective prophylaxis,</li>
        			  <li>deleterious effects due to establishment or dissemination in the environment,</li>
        			  <li>deleterious effects due to the natural transfer of inserted genetic material to other organisms.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
      		  <li>The assessment referred to in Article 4(2) should be based on the following:
              <ol>
      		      <li>the identification of any potentially harmful effects, in particular those associated with:
        			    <ol>
        			      <li>the recipient micro-organism;</li>
        				    <li>the genetic material inserted (originating from the donor organism);</li>
        				    <li>the vector;</li>
        				    <li>the donor micro-organism (as long as the donor micro-organism is used during the operation);</li>
        				    <li>the resulting GMM;</li>
        			    </ol>
                </li>
      			    <li>the characteristics of the activity;</li>
      		    	<li>the severity of the potentially harmful effects;</li>
      			    <li>the likelihood of the potentially harmful effects being realised.</li>
      		    </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Procedure</em>
      		<ol>
            <li>The first stage in the assessment process should be to identify the harmful properties of the recipient and, where appropriate, the donor micro-organism, and any harmful properties associated with the vector or inserted material, including any alteration in the recipient&rsquo;s existing properties.</li>
          	<li>In general, only GMMs which show the following characteristics would be considered appropriate for inclusion in class 1 as defined in Article 4(3):
          		 <ol>
          		   <li>the recipient or parental micro-organism is unlikely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants <a href="#2annexIII" id="2annexIIIback">(2)</a>;</li>
          			 <li>the nature of the vector and the insert is such that they do not endow the GMM with a phenotype likely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants <a href="#2annexIII" id="2annexIIIback">(2)</a>, or likely to have deleterious effects on the environment;</li>
          		   <li>the GMM is unlikely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants <a href="#2annexIII" id="2annexIIIback">(2)</a> and is unlikely to have deleterious effects on the environment.</li>
          		 </ol>
            </li>
          	<li>In order to obtain the necessary information to implement this process the user may firstly take into account relevant Community legislation (in particular Directive 2000/54/EC). International or national classification schemes (e.g. World Health Organisation, National Institutes of Health) and their revisions due to new scientific knowledge and technical progress may also be considered.
              <br>These schemes concern natural micro-organisms and as such are usually based on the ability of micro-organisms to cause disease to humans, animals or plants and on the severity and transmissibility of the disease likely to be caused. Directive 2000/54/EC classifies micro-organisms, as biological agents, into four classes of risk on the basis of potential effects on a healthy human adult. These classes of risk can be used as guidance for the purposes of categorisation of the contained use activities in the four classes of risk referred to in Article 4(3). The user may also take into consideration classification schemes referring to plant and animal pathogens (which are usually established on a national basis). The abovementioned classification schemes give only a provisional indication of the risk class of the activity and the corresponding set of containment and control measures.</li>
          	<li>The hazard identification process carried out in accordance with points 3 to 5 should lead to the identification of the level of risk associated with the GMM.</li>
          	<li>Selection of the containment and other protective measures should then be made on the basis of the level of risk associated with the GMMs together with consideration of:
          	   <ol>
                 <li>the characteristics of the environment likely to be exposed (e.g. whether in the environment likely to be exposed to the GMMs there are known biota which can be adversely affected by the micro-organisms used in the contained use activity);</li>
          			 <li>the characteristics of the activity (e.g. its scale and/or nature);</li>
          			 <li>any non-standard operations (e.g. the inoculation of animals with GMMs; use of equipment likely to generate aerosols).</li>
          		 </ol>
          		 <br>Consideration of items (i) to (iii) for the particular activity may increase, reduce or leave unaltered the level of risk associated with the GMM as identified under point 6.</li>
          	<li>The analysis carried out as described above will finally lead to the assignment of the activity to one of the classes described in Article 4(3).</li>
          	<li>The final classification of the contained use should be confirmed by reviewing the completed assessment referred to in Article 4(2).</li>
          </ol>

      <section>
      <p><em>General principles</em></p>
  	  <ol>
  	    <li>These tables present the normal minimum requirements and measures necessary for each level of containment.</p>
  		  <p>Containment is also achieved through the use of good work practices, training, containment equipment and special installation design. For all activities involving GMMs the principles of good microbiological practice and the following principles of good occupational safety and hygiene shall apply:</p>
  		  <ol>
  		    <li>to keep workplace and environmental exposure to any GMM to the lowest practicable level;</li>
  			  <li>to exercise engineering control measures at source and to supplement these with appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment when necessary;</li>
  			  <li>to test adequately and maintain control measures and equipment;</li>
  			  <li>to test, when necessary, for the presence of viable process organisms outside the primary physical containment;</li>
  			  <li>to provide appropriate training of personnel;</li>
  			  <li>to establish biological safety committees or subcommittees, if required;</li>
  			  <li>to formulate and implement local codes of practice for the safety of personnel, as required;</li>
  			  <li>where appropriate, to display biohazard signs;</li>
  			  <li>to provide washing and decontamination facilities for personnel;</li>
  			  <li>to keep adequate records;</li>
  			  <li>to prohibit eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or the storing of food for human consumption in the work area;</li>
  			  <li>to prohibit mouth pipetting;</li>
  			  <li>to provide written standard operating procedures where appropriate to ensure safety;</li>
  			  <li>to have effective disinfectants and specified disinfection procedures available in case of spillage of GMMs;</li>
  			  <li>to provide safe storage for contaminated laboratory equipment and materials, when appropriate.</li>
        </ol></li>
  		  <li>The titles of the tables are indicative:
  		    <p>Table I A presents minimum requirements for laboratory activities.</p>
  		    <p>Table I B presents additions to and modifications of Table I A for glasshouse/growth-room activities involving GMMs.</p>
  	  	  <p>Table I C presents additions to and modifications of Table I A for activities with animals involving GMMs.</p>
  		    <p>Table II presents minimum requirements for activities other than laboratory activities.</p>
  		    <p>In some particular cases, it might be necessary to apply a combination of measures, from Table I A and Table II, of the same level.</p>
  		    <p>In some cases users may, with the agreement of the competent authority, not apply a specification under a particular containment level or combine specifications from two different levels.</p>
  		    <p>In these tables &lsquo;optional&rsquo; means that the user may apply these measures on a case-by-case basis, subject to the assessment referred to in Article 4(2).</p>
        </li>
  		<li>In implementing this Annex, Member States may in addition incorporate in the following tables the general principles set out in points 1 and 2, with a view to clarifying the requirements.</li>
